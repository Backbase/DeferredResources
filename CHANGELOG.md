# CHANGELOG

### Snapshot
_Not yet released in a stable build_

* Introduce `SdkIntDeferredColor`, a `DeferredColor` implementation that delegates to different `DeferredColor` sources
  depending on the Android OS runtime version.
* Add a few extension functions for accessibility to the view extensions library, including `setContentDescription`.
* Use AppCompat to improve DeferredColor and DeferredDrawable implementations on Android OS versions < 23. In
  particular, default DeferredColor implementations can resolve attribute-backed color selectors, and default
  DeferredDrawable implementations can resolve vector drawables and tints correctly.
* Compile with Kotlin 1.4.10 and publish the source code in explicit mode.
* Target Android SDK 30.

## 1.0.0
_2020-07-29_

ðŸš€ Official stable release!

Add `DeferredColor.resolveToStateList` to support resolving color `<selector>` elements from XML
resources and attributes.

## 0.5.1
_2020-07-22_

Update internal `DeferredColor.Resource` and `DeferredColor.Attribute` logic to resolve the default
color of color selector resources instead of crashing.

## 0.5.0
_2020-07-14_

**Breaking change**: Update DeferredDrawable.Resource's `transformations` constructor parameter to
receive the resolving Context as a parameter. This breaks binary compatibility by removing
constructors with a Function1 parameter in their signature (replaced by a Function2 parameter). This
also breaks source compatibility for Java consumers but not for Kotlin consumers.

Add `deferred-resources-view-extensions` to simplify use of Deferred Resources with Views. Basic
extensions are provided for View, TextView, and ImageView.

Add `DeferredColorWithAlpha` along with a corresponding `withAlpha` extension on `DeferredColor`, to
make alpha transformations on unresolved `DeferredColor`s simple.

## 0.4.0
_2020-06-23_

Add `DeferredDimension.Attribute` to support dimension attribute resolution. Add
`DeferredText.resolveToString` as a convenience for converting the resolve CharSequence to a string.

Update minimum supported Java version to Java 8.

## 0.3.1
_2020-06-17_

Add the `@Px` annotation to the integer pixel value parameter of `DeferredDimension.Constant`'s
convenience constructor.

## 0.3.0
_2020-06-09_

Add a `text` package with various text helpers allowing conversion formatted and/or pluralized text
and regular deferred text when partial resolution information is known (i.e. format arguments and/or
quantity).

Add `DeferredColorDrawable` as a convenience for deferred creation of a solid-color Drawable.

Add a convenience constructor for parsing a color string to create a `DeferredColor.Constant`.

## 0.2.0
_2020-05-22_

Add `DeferredTypeface`, `DeferredIntegerArray`, and `DeferredTextArray`.

## 0.1.0
_2020-05-15_

Initial preview release. Declare booleans, colors, dimensions, drawables, integers, plurals, and
text from resources or code without a Context, relying on the consumer to resolve them.
